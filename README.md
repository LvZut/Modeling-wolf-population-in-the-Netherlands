# Modeling-wolf-population-in-the-Netherlands
This Github repository contains code that can be used to simulate and visualise the effects of several factors and events in an ecosystem with a single predator and two types of prey. 

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks:

    - Lotka-Volterra test.ipynb
    - Previous version (1 predator 1 prey model).ipynb

The first notebook contains the most recent code. The second notebook is an older implementation containing a model with only a single predator and a single prey.

To run the code you need:

    - jupyter notebook

For information on how to install Jupyter Notebook, refer to:
https://jupyter.org/


run the command: jupyter notebook in your terminal to open jupyter notebook.

Once jupyter notebook is running open the file lotka-volterra test.ipynb in the
notebook.

Run all the cells by going to kernel -> restart & run all.

To start the simulation press the button Run interact.
Use the sliders to change the parameters
